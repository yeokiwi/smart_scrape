Based on the content from the Glints TalentHub blog post titled **"What Fresh Graduates in Singapore Look For in Their First Job"**, here's a concise summary of the key points:

### Key Priorities for Singaporean Fresh Graduates:
1. **Career Growth & Development**:  
   - Graduates prioritize roles offering clear progression paths, mentorship, and skill-building opportunities.  
   - Companies with structured training programs or learning stipends are highly attractive.  

2. **Work-Life Balance**:  
   - Flexible work arrangements (e.g., hybrid/remote options) and avoidance of excessive overtime are critical.  
   - Mental well-being and personal time are emphasized over traditional "hustle culture."  

3. **Company Culture & Values**:  
   - A collaborative, inclusive, and supportive environment is non-negotiable.  
   - Alignment with ethical practices (e.g., sustainability, diversity) influences job decisions.  

4. **Compensation & Benefits**:  
   - Competitive salaries remain important, but holistic benefits (healthcare, wellness perks, bonuses) are equally valued.  
   - Financial stability is a concern amid rising living costs.  

5. **Meaningful Work**:  
   - Roles offering purpose or societal impact (e.g., ESG initiatives, innovation) are preferred over purely profit-driven jobs.  

6. **Job Security**:  
   - Economic uncertainty post-pandemic makes stability a significant factor, especially in SMEs vs. startups.  

7. **Location & Commute**:  
   - Proximity to home or accessible public transport reduces burnout and costs.  

### Employer Takeaways:
- **Revamp JD/Employer Branding**: Highlight growth opportunities, flexibility, and values.  
- **Invest in Development**: Offer mentorship and upskilling to retain talent.  
- **Prioritize Well-being**: Promote work-life balance openly.  
- **Competitive Packages**: Balance salary with non-monetary perks (e.g., mental health support).  

### Why This Matters:  
Fresh graduates (Gen Z) are reshaping Singaporeâ€™s job market by prioritizing **long-term growth** and **holistic well-being** over traditional metrics. Employers must adapt to attract this demographic.
